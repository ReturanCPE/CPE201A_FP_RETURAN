CPE007: Final Project Reflection Paper
Before I took the CPE007 course, my idea of Computer Engineering was very simple, like “oh it’s
about computers so maybe it’s for me.” But honestly, I don’t really know the engineering part of it. I
just chose the course because I’m interested in computers, especially hardware, but I’m unsure if I
can really do engineering since it sounds hard and scary. I was curious but also confused because
engineering feels like only super smart people can do it, but I still wanted to try because maybe I can
learn something new or maybe I can handle it if I push myself.
During the course, I learned that Computer Engineering is not only computer parts or fixing PCs, but
also the design, development, and testing of computer systems, software, and networks. It also
needs understanding of logic, architecture, and even human-computer interaction. I also learned
that successful engineers are problem solvers, detail-oriented, creative, and always learning. Even
though no specific lesson completely changed my whole perspective, the class still made me see that
Computer Engineering is more complex and bigger than I first thought.
After taking the course, even though I still struggle and feel like I’m not keeping up sometimes, I
slowly understand more what Computer Engineering expects from a student. I realize I’m just not
used to these tasks and workloads yet, but I can adapt little by little. I also became more aware of my
skills, especially when I learned some C++ in another class. It gave me a small confidence boost that I
can actually code and learn new things. Overall, the course helped me see that Computer
Engineering is a challenging field, but it’s something I can grow into as long as I keep trying and don’t
give up.
